    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">
        <q>A <strong>computer</strong> is a digital <u>electronic machine</u> that can be programmed to 
    carry out sequences of arithmetic or <strong>logical operations</strong> (computation) automatically. Modern computers <i>can perform 
    generic</i> sets of operations known as programs.</q>
</blockquote>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#History">The <strong>abacus</strong> was initially used for <u>arithmetic 
    tasks.</u> The <i>Roman abacus</i> was developed from devices used in
    <strong>Babylonia</strong> as early as 2400 BC.</blockquote>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computer"><strong>Charles Babbage,</strong> an English 
    <u>mechanical engineer</u> and polymath,  originated the concept of a <i>computer.</i> Considered the "father of the computer",[17] he 
    conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. </blockquote>
